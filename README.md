Dancing Rabbit from Looney Tunes
A porting to canvas HTML5 game that have been already built with Flash.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Game specification can be found in "specs" folder. There some changes from original specification, and I also made
some modification for the game easy to play and easy for implementing. Yes, this game is for testing purpose only
since the Flash version has been done as well.

This game request deploying to webserver, so you must do this deploying to ensure the game works correctly.
The source code comes with "NODE.JS" server, so you can install node.js - download from nodejs.org/, then running

node /server/web-server.js

The nodejs server will start shortly, so you can open from your web browser http://localhost:8000/index.html

The game is still being developed, so I will commit daily with couple changes. Remember to always pull from remote
repository
